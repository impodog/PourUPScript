PUPS Standard Library: sys

INTRO:

Provides information about the PUPS system.

VARIABLES:

.version : str
    The version string defined in source/const.cpp.

FUNCTIONS:

.is_toplevel => bool
    Returns if the current map is at the top level(being executed directly in CPP code).
    This is especially useful to avoid running the main function when testing other parts of the file.

.ver_cmp str str => bool
    Returns if the left version is greater than or equal to the right version.
    Normally, you put sys.version on the left side and the minimal version on the right side.
