PUPS Standard Library: memory

INTRO:

Provides commonly used functions about pointers.

FUNCTIONS:

.swap obj obj => pending
    Swaps the two objects by using the current pointers.
    Do NOT use this with direct references to builtin objects, such as "pending" or "true".
    This only swaps the current reference, other pointer-same objects are NOT affected.


.same obj obj => bool
    Returns if the two objects have the same pointer to some data.
    To check equality of instances, use "obj.eq" or "equal obj obj" instead.
