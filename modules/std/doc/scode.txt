PUPS Standard Library: scode

INTRO:

Works between strings and your PUPS code.

FUNCTIONS:

.find str => obj
    Finds the object with the id defined by the argument.
    Note that the return value is NOT linked to the origin. To find a reference, use "find_ref" instead.

.find_ref str => ref
    Finds the reference to the object with the id defined by the argument.
    It is not a value, so use ".data" to access it.

.format => str
    Gets the formatted string of the current map. You should use "print" to show it.
    This filters temporary items. To get everything, use "format_all" instead.

.format_all => str
    Gets the formatted string of the current map. You should use "print" to show it.
    This gives the string of everything.
