#rule allow-no-colon = true / false / default(=false)
    This rule allows you to skip colons on properly used blocks, with extra indent on lines.
    The compiler adds colon automatically.


#rule module = true / false / default(=true)
    This rule defines whether this file should be compiled as a module.
    The module mode defines the constant names with the file stem mixed into it, so it would not mix up with others.
    It is better not to change this unless the file is not used as modules, and needs very quick interpretation.
