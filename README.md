# PUPS - PourUPScript

## Introduction

PUPS is a scripting language that uses the abstract class as the base for all imaginable objects - PUPS::ObjectBase.

The idea takes after SmallTalk, where everything is an object, and calls are done by sending messages to objects.

PUPS aims for being fast, flexible on top of the restricted Cpp-Style grammar, which does not fit well with some development needs.
